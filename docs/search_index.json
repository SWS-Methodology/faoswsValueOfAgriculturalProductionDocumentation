The implementation of the procedure needs to be validated by matching the results disseminated by FAO until now. In order to perform the validation, disseminated data needs to be available within SWS in the corresponding dataset of Dissiminated Dataset Domain. After the validation, the procedure can be applied on the corresponding production value and prices presents within the system and stored in a new Value of Production dataset. 1.1 Module Workflow As shown in the figure below, the general workflow of the module require that the Technical Unit store data in Disseminated Dataset to allow the plugin to ingest the right data. Gross Production Value Plugin Data Flow 1.2 Build up data for validation of procedure For the validation of the existing procedure, data are imported into different supporting datatable in SWS. For instance Item list, Countries list and group compositions are fetched as follow: Country list is obtained from Definitions and standards section of FAOSTAT Value of Production dataset and uploaded into SWS Value of production - Countries datatable; Country group list is obtained from Definitions and standards section of FAOSTAT Value of Production dataset and uploaded into SWS Value of Production - Country Group datatable; Item list is obtained from Definitions and standards section of FAOSTAT Value of Production dataset and uploaded into SWS Value of Production - Item datatable; Item group list is obtained from Definitions and standards section of FAOSTAT Value of Production dataset and uploaded into SWS Value of Production - Item group datatable; International prices are obtained from FAOSTAT FENIX Producer Prices - Supplementary dataset and uploaded on SWS Supplementary International Dollar datatable; A detailed description of each supporting datatable is reported in SWS resources section of this documentation. Since historical disseminated data may differ from those present on the Statistical Working System, it is necessary to make it available on SWS. To do this the CSI-SWS technical team need to retrieve the data from the the dissemination platform (FAOSTAT) and update it on Disseminated Domain. Once the procedure is done, Production and Prices data will be in line with disseminated one and the calculation should match the historical data. 1.3 SWS implementation procedure The plugin will work within a session, meaning that the user needs to select the elements and the years for which they intend to calculate the Value of Agriculture Production, then run the plugin within the new created session. It is worth noting that for the sake of consistency with FAOSTAT item/country list and for calculation of the aggregates, the plugin will always return values for all the countries and items specified into the supporting data table \"Value of production - Countries\" and \"Value of Production - Item\" The module will pull its data directly within the working system, allowing the user to choose the source of data both for Production data and for Annual Producer Prices. For instance, if Disseminated Datasets source is not selected: Production data in tonnes (element 5510/55100) are pulled from Agriculture Production domain, dataset Agriculture Production; Annual Producer Prices data for Standard Local Currency (element 5531) and US Dollar (element 5532) are pulled from Producer Prices domain, dataset Annual Producer Prices (Validated) Annual Producer Prices data for International Dollar (element 5533) are pulled from Producer Prices domain, dataset International dollar prices. If Disseminated Datasets source is selected, the plugin will pull its data from the corresponding datasets of the Disseminated Datasets domain, however since International dollar prices are not disseminated, they will be always fetched in Producer Prices domain. For the calculation of the element 434 Gross per capita Production Index Number the plugin will require also the total population by sex, element 511 from Population Disseminated of Disseminated datasets domain. For the correct functioning of the module it is important to ensure that the read permissions on the datasets mentioned above are correctly guaranteed. 1.4 Output of the plugin The module will return the time series for all the elements selected in the session. The output elements are listed in the table below: Table 1.1: Value of Agricultural Production Plugin calculated elements.

For instance the concept of production may change according to the specific commodity and can be summarized as follows: Crop production data refer to the actual harvested production from field or orchard and gardens, excluding harvesting and threshing losses and the part of crop non harvested. Production includes also the quantities sold in the market (marketed production) and the quantities consumed by the producers (autoconsumption). Crop production is stored in metric tonnes. Livestock production data is more commodity-specific, evaluated by weights and adjusted by conversion factors to provide comparable data. Producer prices refers to the prices received by farmers per unit, usually a metric ton of product. The producer prices are also often defined farm gate prices, and should includes all the costs incurred by the farmers to produce the commodity and its own profit. Various approaches are considered for the definition of Agricultural Production, spacing from gross concept to net depending on the treatment of the double-counting error. The latter is defined as the error that incur when we do not remove inputs used during the production cycle. Agricultural inputs are indeed divided in three categories : commodities required as inputs for their own production, such as seed or hatching eggs; inputs of other agricultural commodities as those used for feeding livestock; non-agricultural inputs such fertilizers or pesticides. 2.1 Gross Production Value Value of gross production is calculated by multiplying gross production (in tonnes) by production prices at farm gate. In this phase of aggregation the overall value of production in considered. Indeed a double-counting error rise if we do not remove seeds and feed used within the agricultural sector, we refer then to this value as gross production. Value of gross production is provided in both International Dollar [Int.$], Standard Local Currency [SLC] and United States Dollar [US$]. The gross value of production expressed in constant terms, shown in formula (2.1), is derived using the average prices across a base period of three years. Constant price series shows the changes in quantity or volume of the product changes over time. \\[\\begin{equation} G_{t} = Q_tP_0 \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(Q_t\\) is production at time \\(t\\) and \\(P_0\\) is the average producer price across base period. The gross value of production in current terms considers the current producer prices at time \\(t\\) (\\(P_t\\)) instead : \\[\\begin{equation} G_{t} = Q_tP_t \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] 2.2 Net Production Value FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single farm, therefore there is the need to subtract amounts of seed and feeds from production quantity to avoid double counting them. \\[\\begin{equation} N_{t} = Q_tP_0 - S_t - F_t \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(Q_t\\) is production at time \\(t\\), \\(P_0\\) is the average producer price around base year, \\(S_t\\) the amount of seed and \\(F_t\\) the amount of feed at time \\(t\\).  It is worth noting that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group crops and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group livestock products. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed. In practice, item aggregation are performed as follow: Only seeds are subtracted from production quantity when computing aggregates Cereal, Total (1717), Roots and Tubers, Total (1720), Oilcrops Primary (1730), Crops (PIN) (2041), Sugar Crops Primary (1723), Vegetables and Fruit Primary (1739), Fruit Primary (1738), Vegetables Primary (1735); Only feed is subtracted from production quantity when computing aggregates Meat indigenous, total (1770) and Milk, total (1780) Both seeds and feed are subtracted from production quantity when computing aggregates Livestock (PIN) (2044), Agriculture (PIN) (2051), Food (PIN) (2054) and Non Food (PIN) (2057) 2.3 Gross Production Index Number The Gross production index number aim is to show the relative level of agricultural production for each year with respect to the three-year base period considered. The index belongs to the Laspeyres quantity with fixed weights (Producer Prices) and its base quantity is revised regularly after 5-10 years. As stated before the base period is not a single year, but an average of three consecutive years to mitigate the year-to-year fluctuations of agricultural production. The production quantity for each commodity is weighted by a constant average across the base period of the international prices obtaining the Gross Production Value for each year, then divided by the average of the gross production for the base period considered as shown in the formula (2.3). \\[\\begin{equation} V_t = \\frac{Q_tP_0}{Q_0P_0} \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(Q_t\\) is the production quantity of the single commodity in year \\(t\\), \\(Q_0\\) is the average production quantity across the base period and \\(P_0\\) is the average Producer Price of the commodity across the base period. Note also that the quantity \\(Q_tP_0\\) correspond to the Gross Production value for period \\(t\\) and quantity \\(Q_0P_0\\) to the average of Gross Production across base period.  The constant price approach allows the evaluation of agricultural outputs in different countries using a single set of prices for various commodities expressed in common currency units such as the International Dollar. The aggregate volume of agriculture production, for a single country \\(j\\), is obtain through the sum of individual item. For instance in case of \\(N\\) commodities : \\[\\begin{equation} V_{jt} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{Q_{it}P_{i0}}{Q_{i0}P_{i0}} \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] The value of the output in the \\(j^{th}\\) country, \\(V_{jt}\\), expressed in international dollars is now directly comparable to that of another country. These value aggregates may be summed over all countries (\\(N\\)) to calculate the value of Regional or World output. \\[\\begin{equation} V_{t} = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{j=1}^M \\frac{Q_{ijt}P_{i0}}{Q_{ij0}P_{i0}} \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] "],["value-of-production-plugin.html", "Chapter 3 Value of Production Plugin 3.1 Data Flow 3.2 Aggregates 3.3 Run the module", " Chapter 3 Value of Production Plugin 3.1 Data Flow The general workflow of the Value of Agricultural Plugin can be summarized as follow : From Input data --&gt; Gross production calculation --&gt; Gross Production index Number calculation --&gt; Aggregates calculations --&gt; Final Output The function require as input Production in tonnes and Annual Producer prices. The calculation will be performed for all the items defined in the supporting data table \"Value of Production - Item\" and for all the countries in \"Value of production - Country\", then aggregated at item-group and region level. The aggregation at region level will follows groups composition specified in FAOSTAT, the plugin will also adjust the composition of the groups by years to match the correct composition according to the validity period of each countries. 3.1.1 Input data Flow The source of inputs data for the plugin is structured as follow: Gross Production Value Plugin Input data flow The plugin allows the user to choose the source for both Production and Prices through two different parameters, for instance, if some data is currently unavailable in Disseminated Datasets it is possible to select another source for the calculation. It is worth noting that pulling data from production datasets may lead to different results with respect to the disseminated one since some of the source data may differ or miss respect to FAOSTAT data. 3.1.1.1 Additional informations The plugin will automatically pull data for indigenous meat with element code [55100] instead of [5510] The production quantity for CPC Item Other meat n.e. (excluding mammals) [21170.92] will be pulled from SWS with item code [21119.90] instead. 3.2 Aggregates The plugin calculate the Gross Production value at different aggregation value : Item groups and Regions Regions and single-Items Item groups and Regions. The items and countries group lists are obtained from the Definitions and Standards section of the dissemination platform website ( FAOSTAT ). They are described and reported on the SWS Resources section section of this documentation. It is important that the technical unit validate those table to ensure that they are up-to-date and the right aggregations are performed. 3.3 Run the module Log-in into SWS; Select New Query and choose Agriculture Production Domain, Value of Agricultural Production dataset; Select the geographicAreaM49, measuredElement, measuredItemCPC and timePointYears in which you are interested and run the query; Running Session Once you created your session select run plugin as shown in picture below; Running Plugin Select the parameters: level of aggregation and Data sources. The user can also choose the execution method for the plugin, if many elements and long time-span are selected, it is suggested to choose the send me an email option since it can take a few hours to run entirely. Plugin parameters "],["resources.html", "Chapter 4 SWS Resources 4.1 Code Lists 4.2 Data Tables", " Chapter 4 SWS Resources This section enclose a detailed description of all the auxiliary resources needed by the modules to accomplish their calculation. It includes definition of code lists, used to define the various dimensions of data sets, and data tables. 4.1 Code Lists Code lists describe the dimentions that compose the different datasets, they are designed by the users to store analytical results from SWS modules. Each dataset have a set of codes and their associated description, thus Codelists are used within different sets for the sake of standardization, visualization and metadata associated to each dimentions. The code lists that describe Value of Agricultural Production dataset are the following : GeographicAreaM49 : Represent the spatial scale, it is composed by countries territories, , regional aggregates, regional special groups aggregates, global aggregates. measuredElement : Represent the different element calculated by the plugin through the methodology metioned above. For instance Gross production in different currencies and Gross Production index numbers. measuredItemCPC : Those items wants to take measure of production. For example, commodities and commodity groups produced by a country; timePointYears : The time unit (year) data is displayed for. 4.2 Data Tables Datatables are flexible tool made available inside the Statistical Working System to store a wide range of usefull information. They indeed provide a strong support to R module to record countries and items groups composition, to map conversion factors and to store different type of data. Variable names (column names) of datatables are more flexible compared to those of datasets, they can accommodate all kind of names and are not strictly constrained by code lists or by the domain in which they are stored.
